# ESP 32 Mobile LED Controller
Demo project showcasing the usage of various technologies like ESP32, React Native, and WebSocket. The functionality of the project is mainly about controlling a small LED array using a cross-platform mobile application. 

The data flow between the ESP32 (embedded system) and the mobile application relies, at the physical layer, on a WI-FI connection and, at the application layer, on a WebSocket connection.

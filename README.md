# ESP 32 Mobile LED Controller
Demo project showcasing the usage of various technologies like ESP32, React Native, and WebSocket. The functionality of the project is mainly about controlling a small LED array using a cross-platform mobile application. 

The data flow between the ESP32 (embedded system) and the mobile application relies, at the physical layer, on a WI-FI connection and, at the application layer, on a WebSocket connection.

## Getting the project
Clone the git project using
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/julian-zatloukal/ESP-32-Mobile-LED-Controller.git
```

## Build the mobile application
### Setting up the environment
First make sure you have a proper environment to build the application. The project was originally developed on Linux 5.8 Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla) using the official React Native CLI and React Native 0.63.3. Check the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide for Android to ensure all dependencies are met.

### Start the metro server and build the Android application
Start metro server (here you can see the debug logs)
```sh
$ npx react-native start
```
Compile and run Android application
```sh
$ npx react-native run-android
```

## Build the embedded program
### Setting up the environment
The embedded program has been built using Platformio with the espressif32 platform. Itâ€™s recommended using the PlatformIO for VSCode or the PlatformIO Core (CLI) to build the project.
### Using PlatformIO for VSCode
1. Install the official VSCode extension.
2. Open a terminal inside the folder
```sh
$ code .
```
3. Press the check mark button at the bottom right of the IDE to compile or press Ctrl+F5.
4. To upload the compiled program use the arrow button placed next to the build button.

### PlatformIO Core (CLI)
1. Follow the official guide to install the [command line utility](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation.html#installer-script)
2. Build the project
```sh
$ pio run
```
3. Or build and upload to the board
```sh
$ pio run -t upload
```
